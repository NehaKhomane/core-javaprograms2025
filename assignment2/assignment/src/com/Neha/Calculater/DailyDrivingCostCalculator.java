 * Q3. Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much
 * money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon
 * emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following information
 * and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
 * a) Total miles driven per day.
 * b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
 * c) Average miles per gallon.
 * d) Parking fees per day.
 * e) Tolls per day.--------------------------------------******************************************/
